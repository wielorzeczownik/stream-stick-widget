## Commit style

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Commit messages drive automatic changelog generation and version bumping.

| Prefix      | When to use                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `feat:`     | New feature or behavior             |
| `fix:`      | Bug fix                             |
| `chore:`    | Maintenance, dependency updates     |
| `refactor:` | Code change without behavior change |
| `docs:`     | Documentation only                  |
| `style:`    | Formatting, no logic change         |
| `ci:`       | CI/CD changes                       |

Breaking changes must include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer.

Keep commits focused on a single concern. If a change touches both logic and styles, a single commit is fine – if it touches unrelated areas, split it.

## Pull requests
